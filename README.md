Project : Multi-class-Multi-label-classification-using-SVM



Classification of Anuran species using Anuran Calls Dataset by implementing Support Vector Machines.
Here we have tried to solve a multi-class and multi-label problem by training a classifier for each label and implement One-vs-all approach.

Evaluation Metrics:
